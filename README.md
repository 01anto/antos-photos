# Testing

  ## Mobile testing

   - The website was built from the start with mobile first design. It has been tested with
     chrome dev tools on smaller screens and it is responsive.
   - Once the website went live I accessed the website through various phones and ensured
     that it performed as expected.

  ## Desktop testing

 - Large Monitor and TV

   - The website has been tested with chrome dev tools for larger screens and it is
     responsive.
   - Once the website went live I accessed the website using a larger monitor and TV and
     ensured that it performed as expected.

  ## Browser Testing

   - Once the website went live it was run and tested on different browsers and performs
     as expected.

  ## Validator Testing

   - W3C HTML Validator - Passed
   - W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator - Passed
   - Lighthouse Results:
   - ![Lighthouse Results](readme-extras/lighthouse-report-pp1.jpg)

# Bugs

  ## Fixed Bugs

   - Upon running the w3c html validator it highlighted some errors due to spacing typos and stray closing tags. Once removed and 
     retested again the code passed.
   - Upon running lighthouse it highlighted that my background image was affecting my results. The image was resized and this greatly 
     increased the overall result.
   - Upon running lighthouse it highlighted that my navigation tap targets were not sufficiently spaced for small screens. I adjusted
     the padding and this greatly increased the overall result.
  
  ## Unfixed Bugs

   - N/A
  
# Deployment

 - The website was deployed using GitHub pages:

   - Go to the settings tab in the GitHub repository.
   - Using the menu on the left click on the pages tab.
   - In the Branch section use the drop-down menu and select 'main'.
   - After a few minutes the page provided a link to the live website.

# Future Features

   - A hamburger menu for when the site is accessed with devices that have small screens.
   - A sticky header so that the navigation menu scrolls with the user.
   - A button that will redirect the user back to the top of the page after scrolling to the
     bottom.
   - A separate page for the gallery, that separates the photos by category, with each of 
     these having their own category page.
   - A customised thank you page for when a user submits the form.
   - A customised 404 page that allows the user to navigate back to website.
   - A shop style page to allow the user to purchase photos/prints or even upload their 
     own photographs to be edited and customised by the company.
