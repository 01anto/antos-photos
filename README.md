## Features

  - NAVIGATION LINKS/HEADER:

    - The navigation menu is located at the top of the page inside the header.
    - The Anto's Photos logo on the top left refreshes the website when clicked.
    - The other links are located to the top right (HOME, ABOUT, GALLERY and CONTACT US) and when clicked bring the user to the relevant page section.
    - *Note: On smaller screens the Logo will be located and centered at the top of the screen and the other links will display in a column below the logo.

  - HOME:

    - The Home section contains the Sales Pitch. It quickly summarises for the user what the website is about and what services are provided. For customers in a hurry, a book now button is conveniently provided that will bring them straight to the contact us section, bypassing the about and gallery sections.

  - ABOUT:

    - The About section builds on what was said in the home section. It provides the user with an insight to the competency and character of the people that they are thinking of hiring. It emphasises to the user that these are people that know what they are doing and will do an amazing job.

  - GALLERY:

    - The Gallery section presents three images to the user. These images give the user an idea of the photographers style and the type of photographs that they can aspire to have.

  - CONTACT US:

    - The Contact Us section contains a form to allow the user to get in contact with the company.

  - SOCIAL LINKS/FOOTER:
    - Three social links to Facebook, Youtube and Instagram are provided in the website footer. The footer also contains Copyright information.

## Testing

  - Mobile testing:

    - The website was built from the start with mobile first design. It has been tested with chrome dev tools on smaller screens and it is responsive.
    - Once the website went live I accessed the website through various phones and ensured that it performed as expected.

  - Desktop testing:

    - Large Monitor and TV

      - The website has been tested with chrome dev tools for larger screens and it is responsive.
      - Once the website went live I accessed the website using a larger monitor and TV and ensured that it performed as expected.

    - Various Browsers

      - Once the website went live it was run and tested on different browsers and performs as expected.

  - This website conforms to the following:

    - W3C HTML Validator - Passed
    - W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator - Passed
    - Lighthouse Results:

## Bugs

  - Fixed Bugs:

     - Upon running the w3c html validator it highlighted some errors due to spacing typos and stray closing tags. Once removed and retested again the code passed.
     - Upon running lighthouse it highlighted that my background image was affecting my results. The image was resized and this greatly increased the overall result.
     - Upon running lighthouse it highlighted that my navigation tap targets were not sufficiently spaced for small screens. I adjusted the padding and this greatly increased the overall result.

  - Unfixed Bugs:

     - N/A

## Deployment

 - The website was deployed using GitHub pages:

    - Go to the settings tab in the GitHub repository.
    - Using the menu on the left click on the pages tab.
    - In the Branch section use the drop-down menu and select 'main'.
    - After a few minutes the page provided a link to the live website.

## Future Features

 - Future features that I believe could bring value to this website include:

    - A hamburger menu for when the site is accessed with devices that have small screens.
    - A sticky header so that the navigation menu scrolls with the user.
    - A button that will redirect the user back to the top of the page after scrolling to the bottom.
    - A separate page for the gallery, that separates the photos by category, with each of these having their own category page.
    - A customised thank you page for when a user submits the form.
    - A customised 404 page that allows the user to navigate back to website.
    - A shop style page to allow the user to purchase photos/prints or even upload their own photographs to be edited and customised by the company.
